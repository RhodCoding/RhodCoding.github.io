            </div>
             <p>My journey to college has been enjoyable, but it hasn’t always been easy. 
                It gets especially 
                tough when project deadlines come around. I often struggled with procrastination, 
                which meant I didn't always submit on time. Now, I realize that the course I chose 
                is more challenging than I initially thought. But even with the difficulties, 
                I’ve learned a lot and continue to grow. Haha!</p>
